# Parabank Automation Suite (Introductory)

:construction: **Work in Progress**  
This is an introductory project demonstrating the basics of **Postman**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **TestRail** integration. The framework is not complete yet â€” new tests, pages, and API use-cases will be added over time.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repo currently contains:

1. **API tests** defined as a Postman Collection  
2. **UI tests** built with Java, TestNG & Selenium WebDriver  
3. **Scripts** to push results back to TestRail via its REST API  

Think of it as a starter kit â€” expect ongoing updates as we expand coverage and refine patterns.
